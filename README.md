# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is working to train a model to see if the tweet is positive or negative, based on the text it has. Uses Python, Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, SpaCy, and scikit-learn.

Applied the SpaCy library to stem the text into sentences with more meaning and meaningful insights towards the data and removed the other common words. Moreover, have also removed the mentions, URLs, and special characters.

Utilized the power of ensembles to train the data, leading to less prone to overfitting, in addition to training the data using linear models. Moreover, applied optimization tools such as GridCV and RandomizedCV available on the scikit-learn library to carry out hyperparameter optimization of the trained models.

Achieved an accuracy of 70% in correctly predicting the sentiment of the tweet on the test data of size 320,000 tweets.
